Do that here:</p><div class="ContentDownloadButton"><a href="http://www.naturaldocs.org/download" target="_blank">Download</a></div><div class="Heading">Instructions for Windows</div><p>Natural Docs on Windows requires .NET 3.5 or higher.&nbsp; If you're using Windows 7 or later you already have it.&nbsp; If you're using Windows Vista or XP, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22" target="_blank">download it here.</a></p><p>Natural Docs is a command line (console) application so it can be integrated into development environments and build processes.&nbsp; That means there's no graphical interface.&nbsp; If you're already familiar with command line applications you can skip to <a href="#starting_a_new_project">Starting a New Project</a>.&nbsp; Otherwise keep these instructions handy while reading later sections.</p><p>You can run Natural Docs from an icon by creating a shortcut to it.&nbsp; Right click on an empty part of your desktop and select New &gt; Shortcut.&nbsp; In the location field type the full path to NaturalDocs.exe in quotes (for example &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Natural Docs\NaturalDocs.exe&quot;) and put any parameters you need outside the quotes.&nbsp; You'll learn about which parameters to use later.&nbsp; It will look like this:</p><pre>&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Natural Docs\NaturalDocs.exe&quot; C:\My Project\ND Config --pause-before-exit</pre><p>Click Next, give it a name, and click Finish.&nbsp; You'll now have an icon you can double-click to run Natural Docs with those parameters.&nbsp; If you ever need to change them you would right click on the shortcut, select Properties, and change the parameters in the Target field.</p><p>If you are running Natural Docs this way I would recommend always adding --pause-before-exit to the parameter list so the console window doesn't close automatically and you can see the status messages.&nbsp; Once you have everything working the way you want you can change it to --pause-on-error so it only stays open when there's a problem.</p><div class="Heading">Instructions for macOS and Linux</div><p>Natural Docs requires Mono to run on macOS and Linux.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/download" target="_blank">Download it here.</a></p><p>In all the examples below you're going to add &quot;mono&quot; before the command line and use Unix paths, so instead of:</p><pre>NaturalDocs.exe C:\My Project\ND Config</pre><p>you'll use:</p><pre>mono NaturalDocs.exe /My Project/ND Config</pre><p>Natural Docs is a command line (terminal) application so it can be integrated into development environments and build processes.&nbsp; That means there's no graphical interface.&nbsp; If you want to run it manually you have to do it through a terminal window.</p></div><div class="Topic"><div class="TTitle" id="starting_a_new_project">Starting a New Project</div><p><i>If you've already used the old version of Natural Docs with your code, skip to <a href="#upgrading_a_1.x_project">Upgrading a 1.x Project</a>.</i></p><p>First you need to create two folders.&nbsp; One of them will be for the generated documentation and the other will be for Natural Docs' configuration and working data.&nbsp; The latter is called your project configuration folder.</p><p>Run Natural Docs with the project configuration folder as a parameter.&nbsp; Just something like this:</p><pre>NaturalDocs.exe C:\My Project\ND Config</pre><p>It will create three configuration files there for you to edit.&nbsp; We don't have to worry about Comments.txt and Languages.txt for now, we only need Project.txt.&nbsp; Open it up.</p><p>All the configuration files contain explanations of their options so you never have to remember them, they're right there in front of you.&nbsp; You'll see the Project Information section first, so add a Title line with the name of your project:</p><pre>Title: My Project</pre><p>Now scroll down to the Source Code section.&nbsp; This is where you tell Natural Docs which folders to scan.&nbsp; Add them with Source Folder lines:</p><pre>Source Folder: C:\My Project\Source</pre><p>You can have more than one, though if there are a lot of them you also have the option of putting the parent folder and then excluding the ones you don't want instead.&nbsp; If you scroll down to the Source Filtering section you'll see how to do that.</p><p>Next scroll down to the Generated Documentation section and add a HTML Output Folder line to tell Natural Docs where it should go:</p><pre>HTML Output Folder: C:\My Project\Documentation</pre><p>That's it.&nbsp; Now every time you run Natural Docs with the project configuration folder name on the command line it will search those folders for code and build documentation for it.</p><pre>NaturalDocs.exe C:\My Project\ND Config</pre><p>If the language you're using has <a href="../reference/language_support.html#full_support">full support</a> you'll get usable documentation right away.&nbsp; If it only has <a href="../reference/language_support.html#basic_support">basic support</a>, you won't see anything in the output until you <a href="documenting_your_code.html">document your code</a>.</p></div><div class="Topic"><div class="TTitle" id="upgrading_a_1.x_project">Upgrading a 1.x Project</div><p>If you've already been using Natural Docs 1.x on your code, upgrading is easy.&nbsp; First, delete the contents of your documentation folder so the old files don't get mixed in.&nbsp; You can also delete the Data folder in your project configuration folder.&nbsp; It should only contain .nd files, you don't want to delete any of the .txt files in your project configuration folder.</p><p>Now just run the new version with the same command line you used before.&nbsp; Things like this still work:</p><pre>NaturalDocs.exe -i c:\My Project\Source<br />                -p c:\My Project\ND Config<br />                -o HTML C:\My Project\Documentation</pre><p>That's it.&nbsp; Going forward you can either continue to use the command line or switch to using Project.txt.&nbsp; This is a file in your project configuration folder that stores all the settings that were previously on the command line so in the future you can just run Natural Docs this way:</p><pre>NaturalDocs.exe c:\My Project\ND Config</pre><p>Just give it the project configuration folder on the command line, you don't even need -p anymore.&nbsp; To make changes just edit Project.txt.&nbsp; It also copied a few settings from Menu.txt if you had them, like the project title and copyright.&nbsp; Menu.txt isn't used anymore so you can delete it after the first run.&nbsp; The same goes for Topics.txt; its settings were copied into Comments.txt on the first run and it won't be used going forward.</p></div><div class="TOCNavBar"><div class="NNextInTOC"><a href="documenting_your_code.html">Next: Documenting Your Code</a></div></div></div></div></div><div class="Footer"><div class="FCopyrightAndTrademark">Copyright © 2017 Code Clear LLC.</div></div></body></html>
